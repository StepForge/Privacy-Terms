      <h1>StepFit Terms of Service</h1>
      <div class="accent-bar"></div>

      <p>
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of
        <strong>StepFit</strong> (“the App”), a pedometer and fitness
        companion developed by <strong>Iman Mirzazadegan</strong>. By
        installing or using StepFit you agree to be bound by these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
      <p>
        StepFit is intended to help you monitor your daily activity
        (primarily steps) and to support your personal fitness goals. The App
        is not a medical device and does not provide medical advice. Any
        information presented is for general wellness and motivational
        purposes only.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Personal responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for your own health decisions and physical
        activity. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional before
        starting, changing or intensifying an exercise program, especially if
        you have existing medical conditions or concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        StepFit cannot be held liable for injuries, health issues, or damages
        that may occur as a result of following or ignoring activity signals
        shown in the App.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Use of the App</h2>

      <h3>3.1 Acceptable use</h3>
      <p>
        You agree to use StepFit only for personal, non‑commercial purposes
        and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. You may
        not:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>reverse engineer, modify or redistribute the App in an unauthorized way;</li>
        <li>use the App to gain unfair advantage in competitions or rankings;</li>
        <li>attempt to interfere with the normal operation of the App or its services.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.2 Age requirements</h3>
      <p>
        StepFit is not specifically directed at children under the age of 13.
        If you are under 18, you should use the App only with the consent of
        a parent or legal guardian.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data and privacy</h2>
      <p>
        StepFit primarily stores your information locally on your device. No
        central StepFit account is required. Details about the categories of
        data and how they are handled can be found in the
        <strong>StepFit Privacy Policy</strong>, which forms part of these
        Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using StepFit you acknowledge that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          your step and profile data may be processed on your device to
          provide features such as goals, statistics and notifications;
        </li>
        <li>
          when integrating with Health Connect, your data is additionally
          subject to the policies and permissions of that platform.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Health Connect and third‑party platforms</h2>
      <p>
        If you choose to connect StepFit with Health Connect or similar
        platforms, you remain responsible for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>reviewing the permissions requested by StepFit,</li>
        <li>configuring which data types can be read or written,</li>
        <li>
          managing or revoking access via the official settings of that
          platform.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        StepFit does not control or operate Health Connect or any other
        third‑party platform. Their terms and policies apply independently of
        these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>
        StepFit, including its design, graphics, icons, and code, is
        protected by intellectual property laws. You are granted a
        non‑exclusive, non‑transferable license to use the App on devices
        that you own or control, solely for your personal use.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the
        App except as allowed by applicable law or with prior written
        permission from the developer.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Changes, updates and availability</h2>
      <p>
        StepFit may be updated from time to time to improve performance,
        address bugs, adjust visuals, or add / remove features. We do not
        guarantee that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the App will always be available on all devices or platforms,</li>
        <li>all historical data will be preserved across all updates,</li>
        <li>any particular feature will remain available indefinitely.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You are responsible for installing updates to benefit from the latest
        improvements and security fixes.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Disclaimer of warranty</h2>
      <p>
        StepFit is provided on an <strong>“as is”</strong> and
        <strong>“as available”</strong> basis. To the maximum extent permitted
        by law, the developer makes no warranties, express or implied,
        including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness
        for a particular purpose, or non‑infringement.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not warrant that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the step count or other metrics will be perfectly accurate in all
          conditions,
        </li>
        <li>the App will operate without interruption, errors or defects,</li>
        <li>
          any defects will be corrected within a specific timeframe, even
          though we aim to improve the App continuously.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the extent permitted by law, the developer of StepFit shall not be
        liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or
        punitive damages, nor for any loss of data, revenue, profits or
        reputation arising out of or related to your use of the App.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, despite the above, liability is established, it shall be limited
        to the amount (if any) paid by you for the use of the App, excluding
        any hardware, data plans or third‑party services.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        You may stop using StepFit at any time by uninstalling the App from
        your device. We may suspend or discontinue the App or any part of it
        at any time, with or without prior notice, for example if required by
        technical, legal or platform‑policy reasons.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Changes to these Terms</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms may be updated to reflect new features, legal
        requirements, or changes in distribution. When a new version is
        published, your continued use of the App after the update becomes
        effective will be considered acceptance of the revised Terms.
      </p>
